👋 Hello, World! My name is Loïc, and I'm a French Software Engineer at [Publicis Sapient Engineering](https://medium.com/xebia-france). Graduated from [ISEP](https://www.isep.fr/) 🎓 I Still live in Paris 🇫🇷🍷🧀. Writing [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) is only half part of the jobs. Blogging, Training and Speaking at conferences are part of the sharing knowledge vibe I try to keep up with. Ex- organizer and Co-founder of [DataXDay](https://dataxday.fr), I'm part of the [Confluent Community Catalyst](https://www.confluent.io/nominate/) program (first class ✨) and more recently I became a 2020's Kafka Summit [Program Committee](https://kafka-summit.org/program-committee/) member.
